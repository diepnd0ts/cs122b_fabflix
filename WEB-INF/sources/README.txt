Two optimization techniques:
	Batch Insert:
		We used batch insert as an optimization technique  because the query doesnâ€™t need to be reparsed. The queries are all uploaded in one transaction.
	Disable AutoCommit:
		We removed autocommit because manual control allows for faster commit logic.

Comments: XML Parsing Files are under TomcatForm/xmlfiles. You can compile the files here. The main function is under BatchInsert.java.
